# Location Input and Map Display App

This Flutter app allows users to input a location on the first screen and view the location on a map with a marker on the second screen.

## Features

### 1. **First Screen: Location Input**
- Users can enter a location (city name, address, or coordinates) through a text field.
- The app includes basic input validation to ensure the location field is not empty.
- A button is provided to navigate to the next screen after entering the location.

### 2. **Second Screen: Display Location on Map**
- The second screen displays a map with the user’s entered location.
- A marker is placed on the map at the specified location.
- A Flutter package is used to integrate the map functionality.

## Technologies Used
- **Flutter**: For building the user interface.
- **Maps API**: To display the map and the entered location (choose any suitable package like `google_maps_flutter` or `flutter_map`).

## How It Works
1. The user inputs a location on the first screen.
2. After submitting the location, the app navigates to the second screen, where the location is displayed on a map with a marker.
