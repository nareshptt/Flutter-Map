# Location Input and Map Display App

This Flutter app allows users to input a location on the first screen and view the location on a map with a marker on the second screen.

## Features

# 1.First Screen: Location Input
- Users can enter a location (city name) through a text field.
- The app includes basic input validation to ensure the location field is not empty.
- A button is provided to navigate to the next screen after entering the location.

# 2.Second Screen: Display Location on Map
- The second screen displays a map with the userâ€™s entered location.
- A marker is placed on the map at the specified location.
- Users can also locate and display their current location on the map.

# Technologies Used
- **Flutter**: For building the user interface.
- **Maps API**: To display the map and the entered location (choose any suitable package like `google_maps_flutter` or `flutter_map`).

## How It Works
1. The user inputs a location on the first screen.
2. After submitting the location, the app navigates to the second screen, where the location is displayed on a map with a marker.
